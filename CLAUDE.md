Always start by taking a look at the two README.md files and the rest of the docs/ documentation to understand the goal of the project.
Remember to occasionally update the docs to reflect newest additions or newest hurdles.

Please make sure to take a very thorough git commiting and branchding methodology
Like creating commits for most addtions in the feat/fix/doc format.
Creating feature commits for most major additions like feature: project modal creation

Last created to-dos
  ✓ Fix dropdown menu positioning so it doesn't get cut off (if two tasks are on the same board, the menu of the task above gets cut off by the task below) - COMPLETED
  ☐ Actually implement action buttons (edit task, delete task, cancel task [moved to cancelled board])
  ☐ Create and connect ProjectModal component (Project must be set to a folder location with a .git folder set up)
  ☐ Implement data persistence with localStorage
