# Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)

## ✅ MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE

### ✅ What's Working Now:
- **TaskModal**: Fully working, creates tasks in ToDo column
- **TaskSidebar**: Renders with proper styling at all screen widths
- **Board Vertical Space**: FIXED - boards now take full height when sidebar is open
- **Three-dots Menu**: Shows on CLICK (not hover), basic functionality works
- **Action Buttons**: Sidebar edit/cancel/delete buttons have click handlers
- **Responsive Layout**: 4-tier system implemented and working
- **Coding Agents**: Only shows for non-ToDo tasks (fixed)
- **Button Sizing**: Back and plus buttons are larger
- **Modal**: Centered and white text (fixed)

### ❌ Remaining Issues:
- ✅ **Menu Z-Index Bug**: FIXED - Dropdown menus now properly layer over task cards
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks disappear when navigating between projects
- **Minimal View Size**: Need smaller breakpoint for vertical layout (currently 768px, should be smaller)

### 🎯 Next Priority Tasks:
1. ✅ Fix dropdown z-index layering (task cards interfering with dropdowns) - COMPLETED
2. Implement localStorage for task/project persistence
3. Create ProjectModal for project creation  
4. Add actual edit/delete functionality (currently just logs)
5. Adjust minimal view breakpoint to smaller width (maybe 600px?)

### 🔧 Technical Notes:
- 4-tier responsive system working: Minimal(≤768px), Medium(769-999px), Almost Optimal(1000-1399px), Optimal(≥1400px)
- Sidebar CSS fixed with responsive breakpoints
- Vertical scrolling enabled for minimal view
- Click-based dropdown system implemented but needs z-index fix

### Next Debug Steps
1. Check browser dev tools for CSS loading
2. Inspect sidebar HTML to see actual class names
3. Verify CSS selectors match rendered HTML

## 🎯 Phase 1 Tasks (After TaskModal is Fixed)

### Task Creation Flow
1. ✅ Modal CSS styling (already done)
2. 🔲 Fix callback types (blocking issue)
3. 🔲 Connect "+" button to open modal
4. 🔲 Form validation and submission
5. 🔲 Add tasks to kanban columns

### Project Creation Flow
1. 🔲 Create ProjectModal component (copy TaskModal pattern)
2. 🔲 Connect "CREATE PROJECT" button
3. 🔲 Two-mode form (New vs Existing repository)
4. 🔲 Form validation and submission
5. 🔲 Add projects to grid view

### Data Persistence
1. 🔲 Create localStorage utility functions
2. 🔲 Save projects array on changes
3. 🔲 Save tasks array on changes
4. 🔲 Load data on app startup
5. 🔲 Error handling for corrupted data

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
cargo tauri dev

# Check for compilation errors (fast)
cargo check

# Clean rebuild if needed
cargo clean && cargo tauri dev

# Build for production (later)
cargo tauri build
```

```

## 🐛 Current Warnings to Clean Up

**After TaskModal is fixed, clean these:**
- Unused imports in models/mod.rs
- Unused TaskModal import in kanban.rs
- Unused variables (`show_modal`, `create_task`)
- Dead code warnings in model implementations

## 💡 Architecture Decisions Made

### ✅ What's Working Well
- **Context Navigation**: Using enums + signals instead of leptos_router
- **CSS Structure**: Full-width, square design works great
- **Component Separation**: pages/ and components/ structure is clean
- **State Management**: Leptos signals work well for local state

### ❌ What to Avoid
- **Complex Routing**: leptos_router added unnecessary complexity
- **Rounded UI**: Square design fits programmer aesthetic better
- **Component Callbacks**: Current approach is too complex, need simpler pattern

## 🔍 Research Resources

### Leptos Documentation
- [Leptos Book](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/) - Main documentation
- [Component Examples](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples)
- [Forms and Actions](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/view/08_forms.html)

### Component Patterns
Look for examples of:
- Modal components with forms
- Parent-child communication
- Event handling patterns
- Context usage for shared state

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Start Simple**: Get basic form working without callbacks
2. **Incremental**: Add complexity step by step
3. **Reference**: Copy patterns from working examples
4. **Test Fast**: Use `cargo check` for quick validation

## ⚡ Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- ✅ App runs without errors or warnings
- ✅ Can click "+" button to open task creation modal
- ✅ Can submit form to add new task to ToDo column
- ✅ Can click "CREATE PROJECT" to add new project
- ✅ Data persists between app sessions

**Ready to Continue When:**
- Basic CRUD operations work for tasks and projects
- No TypeScript-style compilation errors
- UI feels responsive and professional
- Data doesn't get lost on app restart
