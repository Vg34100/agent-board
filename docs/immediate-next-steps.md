# Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Git Worktree Integration - PARTIALLY WORKING

### ✅ **What's Implemented:**
- **Complete Backend Rewrite**: Proper git2-rs API with comprehensive logging
- **AppData Storage**: Worktrees stored in `%AppData%/agent-board/worktrees/` (safe from cleanup)
- **Action Buttons**: Replaced three dots menu with 📁 (Open Files) and ⚙️ (Open IDE) buttons
- **Console Debugging**: Detailed error logging and command tracking
- **Task Persistence**: Worktree paths saved/restored between sessions

### ❌ **BLOCKING ERROR:**
```
Failed to get HEAD: reference 'refs/heads/master' not found; class=Reference (4); code=UnbornBranch (-9)
```

**Root Cause**: Empty git repos (no commits) don't have HEAD/master branch to create worktrees from.

### 🔧 **Next Debug Tasks:**
1. **Fix Empty Repo Issue**: Handle repos with no initial commit
2. **Alternative Branch Detection**: Try `main` branch or create initial commit
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback when HEAD doesn't exist

### 📊 **Current Implementation Status:**
- **Directory Creation**: ✅ Working (`C:\Users\video\AppData\Roaming\com.video.agent-board\worktrees\`)
- **Git Repo Access**: ✅ Working 
- **Branch Creation**: ❌ BLOCKED by UnbornBranch error
- **Worktree Creation**: ❌ BLOCKED (can't create without HEAD)
- **UI Integration**: ✅ Working (buttons appear, console logs work)

### 🎯 **Immediate Fix Strategy:**
```rust
// Check if repo has commits before creating worktree
let head = match repo.head() {
    Ok(head) => head,
    Err(_) => {
        // Handle empty repo - create initial commit or use different strategy
        return Err("Repository has no commits. Please make an initial commit first.".to_string());
    }
};
```

### 📋 **Test Workflow:**
1. **Create project** with git repo that has **at least one commit**
2. **Create task** → **Click Start** → Should create worktree successfully
3. **Check AppData directory** for worktree folder
4. **Test 📁 and ⚙️ buttons** in sidebar

**Status**: Implementation 90% complete, blocked by empty repo edge case.
