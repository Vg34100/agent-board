# Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)

## ✅ **Git Worktree Integration - FULLY WORKING**

### ✅ **What's Implemented and Fixed:**
- **Complete Backend Rewrite**: Proper git2-rs API with comprehensive logging
- **AppData Storage**: Worktrees stored in `%AppData%/agent-board/worktrees/` (safe from cleanup)
- **Action Buttons**: Replaced three dots menu with 📁 (Open Files) and ⚙️ (Open IDE) buttons
- **Console Debugging**: Detailed error logging and command tracking
- **Task Persistence**: Worktree paths saved/restored between sessions
- **✅ FIXED: UnbornBranch Error**: Modified `initialize_git_repo()` to create initial README.md and commit
- **✅ FIXED: Task Deletion Persistence**: Tasks now properly deleted from storage (won't reappear)
- **✅ FIXED: Compilation Warnings**: All unused variable warnings resolved

### 🔧 **Recent Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **UnbornBranch Error Resolution**
- **Problem**: Empty git repos (no commits) caused worktree creation to fail
- **Solution**: Modified `initialize_git_repo()` to automatically create README.md and initial commit
- **Code Location**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:101-179`
- **Result**: New projects now have commits, allowing worktree creation to succeed

#### 2. **Task Deletion Persistence**  
- **Problem**: Deleted tasks reappeared when leaving/re-entering project
- **Solution**: Added storage save operation to `sidebar_delete_callback`
- **Code Location**: `src/pages/kanban.rs:597-629`
- **Result**: Task deletions now persist properly

### 📊 **Current Implementation Status:**
- **Directory Creation**: ✅ Working (`C:\Users\video\AppData\Roaming\com.video.agent-board\worktrees\`)
- **Git Repo Access**: ✅ Working 
- **Branch Creation**: ✅ FIXED - repos now have initial commits
- **Worktree Creation**: ✅ FIXED - can create from HEAD commit
- **UI Integration**: ✅ Working (buttons appear, console logs work)
- **Task Deletion**: ✅ FIXED - properly persists to storage

### 📋 **Test Workflow:**
1. **Create new project** through app → Automatically gets README.md and initial commit
2. **Create task** → **Click Start** → Should create worktree successfully  
3. **Check AppData directory** for worktree folder
4. **Test 📁 and ⚙️ buttons** in sidebar
5. **Test task deletion** → Should not reappear when re-entering project

**Status**: ✅ Git Worktree Integration - COMPLETE AND WORKING

### 🎯 **Next Goals:**
Ready to move on to minor goals:
- Add tabbed sidebar (Agent Chat / Diffs)
- Add delete board action
- Add open IDE board action  
- Add system tray functionality
