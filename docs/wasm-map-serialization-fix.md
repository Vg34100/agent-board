# WASM Map Serialization Fix

## Problem Summary
Tasks created from browser (localhost) were being saved as empty objects `{}` instead of full task data, causing complete data loss. The HTTP argument serialization worked perfectly, but task objects were getting corrupted during JavaScriptâ†’JSON serialization.

## Root Cause Discovery
**WASM objects are JavaScript Maps, not regular objects.** When serde_wasm_bindgen serializes Rust structs to JavaScript, it creates Map objects, not plain JavaScript objects. `JSON.stringify()` cannot serialize Maps properly - it turns them into empty objects `{}`.

### Evidence from Logs:
```javascript
// Before fix:
âœ… Task serialization SUCCESS: Object {"created_at": String("..."), ...}  // Rust serialization works
Normalized args: Object { projectId: "...", tasks: (1) [â€¦] }              // Array exists  
Args string: {"projectId":"...","tasks":[{}]}                             // JSON.stringify fails on Maps

// After fix:
ðŸ”¥ DETECTED EMPTY OBJECTS IN JSON! Attempting direct serialization...
Processing task: Map(8) { created_at â†’ "...", description â†’ "A", ... }    // It's a Map!
ðŸŽ¯ FOUND THE PROBLEM: Task is a Map! Converting to Object...
âœ… Manual serialization result: {"projectId":"...","tasks":[{"created_at":"...","description":"A",...}]}
```

## The Fix
Modified the JavaScript shim in `index.html` to detect when `JSON.stringify()` produces empty objects for non-empty arrays, then manually convert WASM Maps to plain JavaScript objects:

```javascript
// Detection
if (argsString.includes('[{}') && normalizedArgs.tasks && normalizedArgs.tasks.length > 0) {
  // Manual Map-to-Object conversion
  const manualTasks = normalizedArgs.tasks.map(task => {
    const obj = {};
    if (task instanceof Map) {
      for (const [key, value] of task.entries()) {
        obj[key] = value;
      }
    }
    return obj;
  });
  // Re-serialize with converted objects
  argsString = JSON.stringify({...normalizedArgs, tasks: manualTasks});
}
```

## Key Insights
1. **WASM-JS boundary creates Maps**: `serde_wasm_bindgen` serializes Rust structs as JavaScript Maps
2. **Maps don't JSON.stringify()**: `JSON.stringify(map)` returns `"{}"` instead of object data
3. **Detection is crucial**: Check for `[{}` pattern when arrays should contain data
4. **Manual conversion works**: `Map.entries()` â†’ regular object â†’ `JSON.stringify()` succeeds

## Files Modified
- `index.html`: Added Map detection and conversion in the JavaScript shim's `invoke` function

## Why Other Attempts Failed
- **Custom DateTime serialization**: Wrong layer - problem was in JavaScript, not Rust
- **Error handling improvements**: Good for debugging but didn't fix core issue  
- **String-based DateTime**: Helped with Rust serialization but JS still couldn't handle Maps
- **Enhanced logging**: Critical for discovering the Map issue, but not the fix itself

## Prevention
- Always test WASM struct serialization through the complete JSâ†’HTTP pipeline
- Watch for empty objects `{}` in JSON strings when objects should have data
- Remember that WASM objects may not be regular JavaScript objects
- Use `instanceof Map` checks when dealing with WASM-generated data

## Result
âœ… Tasks created from browser now persist correctly  
âœ… No more data loss between desktop and browser views  
âœ… HTTP argument serialization works perfectly for all operations  
âœ… WASM Map objects properly converted to serializable JavaScript objects
